                Symbolic Airdrop Initiative: BUGS coins intended for "Symbolic
                Airdrop" are sent over time to Solana developers, as well as to
                the most active and hardworking small project developers and
                teams, on the Solana network, in order to support the growth of
                their project, their work, as well as encourage and reward the
                good development of the Solana ecosystem in general.

                The crypto artists (on Solana at the beginning) are also
                concerned. Through this initiative, we are committed to
                supporting creativity, innovation, and the spirit of community
                on the Solana network. This is our most precious goal, to both
                thank our community, developers on the Solana network (projects
                and NFT collections), as well as Solana (team) and users.

                Decentralized Web3 community, around a unique and very famous

                This coin is a memecoin, and has no utility, nor any concrete
                use-case at the moment (unpopular opinion: like 90% of the
                crypto market today, but memecoins are honest at least üòÇ just

                This is your crypto, the community is the heart of the coin. No
                community = no crypto. The community is free to imagine and
                implement a utility in the future. Our community channels are
                full of ideas.
