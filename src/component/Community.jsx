                  Introducing a unique crypto community experience. The
                  community is incredibly crazy - our community is at the heart
                  of Bugs meme. We are tired of crypto projects that are not
                  close to their community and do not recognize them as they
                  should.. here, BUGS belongs to the community, fully community
                  driven.
                </p>
